# Instablog (CMS)
Instablog is a blog content management system that makes it quick and easy to create and share blog posts with the world and view others' blog posts in a snap.  You only need to create an account and then get to typing.  Instablog gives the user full CRUD functionality of their blog posts thanks to it being built with a MERN stack.

# Motivation
At the time of Instablog's creation, I was in the process of building different web apps for my portfolio that demonstrated different aspects of my knowledge and skills as a web developer.  Instablog proves my knowledge of building MERN stack application, offering full CRUD functionality to users over their blog posts.
